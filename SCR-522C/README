To enable full functionality of the SCR-522C/TR1133 radio there are several things 
that you will need to do.  

First you will need to add the following to the <nasal> section of your *set.xml 
file.  

<file>Aircraft/Instruments-3d/SCR-522C/Nasal/SCR-522C.nas</file>

This will enable the F12 key to bring up the frequencies dialog. It will also over ride the 
Equipment --> radios menu item so that it brings up the correct menu for the SCR-522C/TR1133
radios.

For dark conditions when cabin/cockpit illumination is used all of the radio models object respond to 

<property>/controls/lighting/cabin-norm</property>

If you are using a different property for you cabin/cockpit lights you will need to map your property 
to /controls/lighting/cabin-norm.
